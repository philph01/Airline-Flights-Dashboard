For this practice, I've created an Airline Flights Dashboard which is an interactive visualization tool designed to provide insightful analytics for airline flights. The dashboard presents key metrics such as flight status, delays, cancelations, and performance trends, helping stakeholders gain insights into airline operations. The tool is designed with a user-friendly visuals to aid decision-making for aviation professionals, travelers, or anyone interested in aviation data.

I've uploaded the power bi file and static pdf version of the Dashboard. The Dataset consists of 4 separate csv files (e.g. airlines, airports, cancellation_codes, and flights).
And proceeded to do the steps:
- Analyze and familiarize with the dataset
- Transform and load the data
- Build a Relational Model using Star Schema.
- Added DAX Measures
- Designed the Dashboard
